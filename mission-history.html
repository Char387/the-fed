  That's a great insight â€” your chats are part of the origin story of your project and should be preserved as source material on the Federation website.

  Here's how to include them:

  1. Copy and paste your key chats into `.html`, `.txt`, or `.md` files.
  2. Format them with simple HTML tags for structure and readability.
  3. Upload the file to your GitHub repository.
  4. Link to it from your homepage.

  This page is an example of that in action.
